### Hugo 0.126.3

- {{% badge color="fuchsia" icon="fa-fw fab fa-hackerrank" title=" " %}}0.126.3{{% /badge %}} This release requires a newer Hugo version.

### Breaking

- {{% badge style="warning" title=" " %}}Breaking{{% /badge %}} This release provides compatibility for Hugo {{% badge color="fuchsia" icon="fa-fw fab fa-hackerrank" title=" " %}}0.146.0{{% /badge %}} or newer and required to make some breaking changes to internal file structuring.

  You will be affected by this if you

  - call `dependencies.gotmpl` from your own templates. The theme will now generate a warning. Call `dependencies.html` instead.
  - use [page designs](configuration/customization/designs). The underlying content views aren't allowed to be stored in subdirectories anymore. You have to [move them](configuration/customization/designs#migration-from-relearn-7) up one level.
  - use [self-defined output formats](configuration/customization/outputformats#migration-from-relearn-7).
